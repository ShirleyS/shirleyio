I purchased this domain a few years ago and for the better part of that time, left it dormant.

The idea of spinning up a site would get de-prioritized for anything else that came up. The return on designing and maintaining something like this seemed like effort better spent on other 'actually meaningful' projects.

Until recently, I hadn't quite connected the effects of writing and speaking - it's always been there, and I think I do both well enough. Mostly I saw the activities as two separate exercises that coexisted in the same space.

I've begun to consciously focus on the nuances of writing to reinforce both my public speaking confidence and articulation. Writing for the sake of improving my overall communication abilities wasn't an exercise I credited enough, mostly because it wasn't something you see people do.

My friends who seem to be the strongest communicators are incredibly quick to organize their thoughts on the spot. While I hope to get there one day, for now I very much feel this ongoing exercise will help push me in developing my critical thinking and communication skillset.

Communication is the vehicle through which we form more meaningful connections. And what's more important than that?
